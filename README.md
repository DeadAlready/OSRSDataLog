# OSRSDataLog

Fork of WikiSync with the aim of sending parts of user data to a file or a server controlled by the user.
The varbits/varplayers logged are determined by config either locally or by a manifest loaded from the server.

The aim is to provide a way to either keep a log of your progress over time or synchronise with external service
for other purposes.

More information about varbits/varplayers can be found at [https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/VarPlayers,-VarBits,-and-VarClients](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/VarPlayers,-VarBits,-and-VarClients)
